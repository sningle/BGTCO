<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About
In a survey we sent out, it seemed that a lot of queer people felt they didn't really have access to many resources that helped them during the process of figuring out their identity as well as coming out. We wanted to be part of the solution by creating a website that would allow queer people to:
* Explore resources pertaining to their identity
* Read articles on coming out written by other queer people
* Ask questions anonymously
* Leave advice for others who are coming out
* Learn more about common LGBTQIA+ identities

### Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
* [Pageclip](https://cageclip.co/)

### What's Next
Some ideas for expansion we have so far are taking the user input we receive from the contact page and adding content based on it. Additionally, we would like to expand the infographic page to be inclusive of as many different sexualities and genders as possible, as we believe everyone deserves for their identity to be celebrated and understood.
