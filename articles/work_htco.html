    <h2>
      Do I even need to come out at work?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many people may choose not to come out at work, as keeping their personal
      life separate from their work life may be preferable. However, some queer
      individuals, especially people who are beginning to transition, may want
      to come out so their coworkers know their correct name and pronouns.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, however, if you don’t feel safe or comfortable coming out at
      work, it may not be the right choice. Remember, you are not obligated to
      come out to your coworkers.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What’s an appropriate way to tell the people you work with that you’re
      queer?
    </h2>
    <p>
      For people in queer relationships, it may be difficult to talk about one’s
      home life without bringing up one’s partner. Additionally, trans
      individuals may want to specify their pronouns or name if they’re
      beginning their transition or starting a new job.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to come out, there are plenty of ways to do so. One way is to
      simply work it into a conversation or wait until someone asks about your
      partner. Additionally, if you want to alert your coworkers of your
      pronouns and name, you could include it in your email signature. If you
      work with a lot of people and feel the need to let everyone know your
      pronouns at once, you might ask your boss if they can let everyone know
      via email or in a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people may also choose to only tell select people at work, such as
      the people they interact with regularly. Whatever you decide, coming out
      in the workplace, if you choose to do it, should happen on your timeline
      when you are comfortable.
