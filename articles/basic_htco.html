      What even is coming out?
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a society where heteronormativity and cisnormativity is the standard,
      people who don’t fit into either of those boxes might feel the need to
      “come out.” But what even is coming out? And do you have to do it? If
      you've ever asked yourself either of these questions, we've got you
      covered.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coming out is making your sexual orientation or gender identity known to
      some number of people. Contrary to the way it is often portrayed, however,
      coming out is an ongoing process rather than a singular event. A person
      may choose to come out to only close friends, friends and family, or to as
      many people as possible. There’s no one “right way” to come out and it’s
      your choice to come out (or not come out) to whoever you want.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How do I know if I'm ready to come out or not?
    </h2>
    <p>
      One important thing to consider when coming out is safety. If you feel
      that you would be put in an unsafe situation by coming out to a certain
      person or group of people, it may be best to wait until you have
      sufficient support to do so. While your identity deserves to be
      celebrated, it’s important to think carefully about the benefits as well
      as the risks of coming out in your own life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often it’s best to first come out to someone who you believe will respond
      positively. This may be another queer person or someone who you know is an
      ally to the LGBTQ+ community. Specifically, you might look for online
      queer communities, LGBTQ+ centers, a Gay/Straight alliance at your school,
      or another LGBTQ+ organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should also feel comfortable with coming out. Don't feel pressured to
      come out just because you feel you "should" or because other queer people
      you know have. Whether or not you come out should be solely your choice,
      so think about your own needs when deciding whether or not to tell others
      about your identity.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How do I come out?
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are also many methods of coming out besides directly telling someone
      face-to-face. If it feels more comfortable, you might write them a letter,
      send them a text or email, or call them on the phone to let them know.
      It’s up to you what method of communication you use, although ideally it
      would be whatever makes you most comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, allow time to process. Whoever you're coming out to might
      not be receptive right away, but this does not mean they don’t or cannot
      support you. Give them time to process that information and, if needed,
      you may want to provide them with resources to help them understand you
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your ‘coming out’ experience should be entirely your own; it can be as
      important or as casual as you like and should ultimately be whatever makes
      you most comfortable.
