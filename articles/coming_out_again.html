    <h2>
      I feel embarrassed to come out again, because I feel like I have to admit
      I was “wrong” the first time I came out.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sexuality and gender are fluid, this even though we may identify a certain
      way during one point in our life, we may come to realize we no longer feel
      that way or misinterpreted our feelings later in life. Discovering new
      parts of oneself should never be a shameful or embarrassing experience,
      but rather a cause for celebration in that you’ve learned something about
      yourself that you didn’t know before. While it may feel difficult to come
      out multiple times, it’s simply another part of your process of self
      discovery.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What do I do if people don’t take me seriously since I’ve come out before?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the people you come out to don’t initially understand how you could
      come out more than once, explain to them that you’ve simply changed or
      realized you feel differently now than you did before. You might pose your
      own questions toward them, such as, “Do you feel the same way about your
      partner/ex as you did when you first began dating or first met?” Likely
      their answer will be no, as people tend to change because of their
      relationships as well as other life circumstances and introspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise, one’s sexuality and gender can change for similar reasons. This
      does not make your identity any less valid, as feeling differently over
      time does not negate your previous feelings nor does it invalidate your
      future ones.
