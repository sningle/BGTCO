    <h2>
      What do I do if other people don’t accept me because of their religion?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although it may be difficult to deal with others who don’t accept your
      identity for religious reasons, there are multiple ways to go about trying
      to come out to or interact with those people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people may choose to completely stop interacting with religious
      people who do not accept the LGBTQ+ community for their own well-being.
      Others may try to help those people understand their perspective and come
      to accept queer people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this, one might be interested in The Reformation Project, The
      Religious Institute, or the Human Rights Campaign’s info on debunking
      homophobia in Christianity.
    </p>
    <h2>
      I need guidance as a queer person who is also religious. What does my
      religion say about being queer?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Human Rights Campaign has several documents detailing recommendations
      for religious queer people. Look for one that applies to you below:
