    <h2>
      How do I know if I should come out to a friend or not?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Often it’s best to try to decipher whether a person is supportive of
      LGBTQ+ individuals before coming out to them. You might find this out
      through casual conversation, such as bringing up a gay celebrity and
      asking about their feelings on the person or mentioning a queer person you
      both know. While this may not directly reveal their feelings about queer
      people, you may be able to gauge their level of support to some extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you could ask them directly whether they support the LGBTQ+
      community. If you’re afraid this may cause you to accidentally out
      yourself, you might further explain that you support the LGBTQ+ community
      and that you feel uncomfortable being close with people who don’t.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Is there a reason I should come out to my friends?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Unless you want to, there’s no direct need to come out to anyone. Many
      people choose to come out to their friends to create a support network of
      people who they can talk to about their identity, however if you would
      prefer to keep that aspect of your life private, that’s completely fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s totally up to you whether you choose to tell others about your
      sexuality and/or gender and it doesn’t make you a “bad friend” not to
      share that information if you’re not comfortable.
