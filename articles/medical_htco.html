    <h2>
      What’s a situation where I should come out to my doctor?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you’d like to medically transition or are already medically
      transitioning, it’s generally a good idea to let your healthcare provider
      know, as it may impact your plan of care. You may also choose to let your
      doctor know if you’d like to be tested for certain conditions, as certain
      sexes as well as people with certain sexualities have a higher risk of
      certain diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you may choose to let them know your pronouns and name so
      the office can use them correctly when you visit.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How do I know if my doctor supports LGBTQ+ individuals?
    </h2>
    <p>
      One way to check if your doctor is supportive of LGBTQ+ individuals is to
      call the office beforehand. You might choose not to give your name at the
      beginning of the call and instead ask if the practice has any LGBTQ+
      patients. Alternatively, you can also check the Gay and Lesbian Medical
      Association’s Healthcare <a href=http://www.glma.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&pageId=939&grandparentID=534&parentID=938&nodeID=1>Provider Directory</a> to see if you can find a
      doctor in your area.
