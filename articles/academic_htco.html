    <h2>
      Will I get in trouble for coming out at school?
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are many different options for coming out in an academic setting,
      however what you choose may vary based on your personal situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re afraid you may get in trouble or be bullied by other students
      for coming out, find out what policies your school has in place to protect
      LGBTQ+ students. You may choose to first tell a trusted adult to help you
      speak to school administrators if there are specific requests you’d like
      to make, like having your name changed in their system or notifying your
      teachers of new pronouns. Additionally, if you’re not out at home, be sure
      to communicate to whoever you talk to if you would not like them to
      mention your identity to your parents.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Do my classmates need to know about my identity?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you don’t want to come out to your classmates, you don’t have to.
      However, some people may choose to do so to clarify their pronouns or
      simply to have peace of mind in being able to speak openly about their
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the case, coming out to your classmates is your decision that you
    should consider carefully. Remember, if there are people in your life who
    you would prefer not to be out to, choose who you come out to carefully.
    Some students may not be accepting of their LGBTQ+ peers, which might make
    coming out a more difficult process. If you would like additional support in
    coming out at your school, see if your school has a Gay/Straight Alliance.
    If not, or if you’d prefer to meet other queer people in a more anonymous
    way first, join a queer commnuity online.
