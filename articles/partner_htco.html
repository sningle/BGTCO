    <h2>
      How do I come out to my partner if I’m still attracted to them?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you’re still attracted to people of your partner’s gender and want to
      stay with them but realized you’re not straight, you may decide to come
      out to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, ensure you’re safe to do so. If your partner does not support the
      LGBTQ+ community, you may not want them to know you’re queer. Likewise,
      you may not feel comfortable being in a relationship with them anymore but
      not want to reveal that it’s because of your identity. Regardless, it’s
      better not to put yourself in an unsafe situation if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe your partner will be accepting, you may choose to have a
      conversation with them about your feelings around your sexuality. Expect
      that they may be confused, surprised, or even upset initially, as this may
      be unexpected for them. If you still want to be in a relationship with
      them, be sure to communicate that, as they may assume you’re coming out to
      them to break up with them or let them know you’re not interested in them
      anymore.
    </p>

      of their gender?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Again, your first priority should be your own safety. If you don’t believe
      you can safely come out to your partner, you might choose not to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming out to a partner can be tricky, but be honest about your feelings.
      You may want to communicate to them that they did nothing wrong and that
      you simply discovered something new about yourself. They may be upset,
      however your own identity and comfort are important to honor. It might
      also be useful to think carefully about what information you want to share
      before having a conversation with your partner. You might decide you want
      to explain how you came to the conclusion that you’re gay or a lesbian, or
      you may decide you don’t want to share those details for your own comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, keep in mind that, at the end of the day, your identity is valid
      and deserves respect even if certain people feel upset by your coming out.
      Coming out is about you and your ability to live authentically, not the
      comfort of the people around you.
