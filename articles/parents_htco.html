    <h2>
      When is the right time to come out to my parents?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you’re unsure whether your parents will be accepting of your identity
      or not, it’s best to come out at a time when you know you will still be
      receiving support. Some may choose only to come out when they are
      financially independent and have moved out of their parents homes, while
      others may assume that going to college and being away from home will
      prevent tension between themself and their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, if you’re going to come out to your parents, ensure you’re
      safe first. If you are fully dependent on them and coming out goes poorly,
      it could create a very difficult situation. This doesn’t mean you can
      never come out to your parents, however it’s important to do it at a time
      that will allow you to do so comfortably.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What if my parents don’t believe me or tell me I’m too young to know my
      sexuality or gender?
    </h2>
    <p>
      While your parents may know you well, only you know your inner feelings
      about sexuality and gender unless you tell them directly. Sexuality and
      gender are fluid and can change over time, but that doesn’t make your
      current feelings about them any less valid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your identity is solely yours regardless of how others feel about it. If
      you’re worried about not being accepted or understood, find a safe adult
      who you can speak to about your feelings. Even if you don’t feel you’re
      able to talk to your parents about your identity, there are people who
      will believe you and accept you for who you are.
