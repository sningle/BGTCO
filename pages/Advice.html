    <blockquote>
      "You will be able to participate in the community and get support from the
      community much more once you've at least partially come out, however you
      need to assess the immediate risk that comes along with coming out and
      decide what you feel safe doing. I also think it could be helpful to
      really investigate why you're feeling apprehension, and if that isn't
      because of safety, it's going to be very scary but you will benefit from
      it and it will allow you to start participating in the community more.
      Most LGBT centers have people that will be willing to talk to you and help
      you figure out if you feel safe coming out and what the best way to do
      that would be. I think all of our experiences are very unique so I don't
      have a lot to say about specifically how to come out, but I think
      community is incredibly important. By participating in your LGBT community
      and finding ways to give back to the community, you learn how to be
      yourself and how to treat others in empowering ways." -May

      "I came out to my mom probably about three times. First, I was pansexual,
      then I was gay, and then bisexual. I remember how it felt to have to go
      back and forth and realize I was wrong about myself. I think something
      that's important for someone who is coming out for the first time to
      remember is that even if you have that fear, that you might be wrong or
      not have everything figured out 100%, that's okay. People around you will
      be able to deal with it, or they won't. But the people who will, will
      accept you each time. Not everyone has it figured out, but don't let that
      stop you from coming out if it feels right." -Gab
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "It might hurt what other people say at first, but you have to block them
      out and pay attention to the ones who truly care and accept you. It might
      mean there will be a lot of people cut out if your life, but there will be
      that sacred few that mean the world and will fight with you." -anonymous
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "Don't feel pressured to find a label for yourself. It is 100% not
      necessary if it is something you are not interested in doing." -M.Y.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "If you're like me, and were afraid of coming out...as long as your parents
      love you. They'll just care that you're going to be you. There are a lot
      of horror stories but for the most part, they will get used to you being
      you." -Ebin
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      "When I have these conversations with people I like to talk about two
      things: safety and benefit. If there are safety concerns we then talk
      about ways that they can still participate in the community without
      putting themselves at risk and how that could help them long term. If
      there are not safety concerns there are probably still a lot of emotional
      reasons that make it difficult so I like to discuss not how to come out
      but the benefits I'm just putting yourself out there to the people you
      care about. There is no right way to come out but there is value in being
      able to benefit from a community of like minded people and there is even
      more value in being able to give back to that community. I've taken many
      people that have not came out or people that have not been able to
      participate in the community to all of the community centers in the city
      to introduce them to people and resources. My advice any thoughts on this
      or probably not very valuable considering we're still in the middle of a
      pandemic but I think a community ethic and volunteerism can help build
      confidence in yourself and help you learn how to build that confidence in
      others." -May

    <blockquote>
      "My own journey with figuring out my gender and sexuality were complicated
      at best, but discovering myself and being able to share that with others
      has been such an incredibly rewarding experience. No matter who you are or
      who you love, there will be people who love, accept, and support you
      more than you can imagine if you seek them out. You are worthy of all the
      love you need to get by." -savn
