    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What even is coming out?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        “Coming out” is the process of telling other people about your sexuality
        or gender identity. Despite how coming out is sometimes portrayed in
        popular media, it’s often an ongoing process and is different for
        everyone. Some people may choose to come out to everyone in their life
        and talk openly about their identity. Others may choose to only share
        information about their sexuality or gender identity with family,
        friends, or partners. Ultimately, coming out is a process that is unique
        to you and can take many different forms depending on what you’re
        comfortable with.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Do I have to come out?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The short answer? No.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming out is a deeply personal choice that shouldn’t be taken lightly.
        You shouldn’t feel pressured to come out if you’re not ready or simply
        don’t wish to do so. Ultimately, coming out is just a way of letting
        people know about your gender identity or sexuality. Some may choose to
        come out because they want people to know they go by different pronouns
        or a different name than they did previously. Others may simply want to
        celebrate their identity with the people around them or normalize their
        identity in their everyday life. Whatever the reason, coming out should
        be a choice you make because you want to, not because you feel you
        “should” or even “have to.”

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">
      How do I know if the label I chose is “right” or not?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        There is no “right” or “wrong” way to label yourself, as the way you
        label (or choose not to label) your sexuality or gender is entirely up
        to you. Many people fear they will eventually “change their mind” or
        have to come out again if they’re “wrong,” but, while it’s possible you
        will later choose to label yourself differently, there’s nothing wrong
        with selecting a label that you feel fits you, even if it may be
        temporary. If you eventually choose to identify differently, there’s
        also no shame in coming out however many times you need to.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">
      How do I come out if I don’t have a label for my gender/sexuality?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Not everyone wants to put a label on their gender or sexuality and
        that’s okay. If you choose not to label yourself but still want to come
        out, there are lots of ways to do it. Some people may choose to say
        they’re queer or not straight / not cis without elaborating further.
        Others may choose to simply state that they don’t resonate with their
        assigned gender at birth or don’t feel they’re only attracted to members
        of the opposite sex. It’s also an option to say you’re still questioning
        or that you’re exploring your identity if you feel you’ll eventually
        settle on a label but don’t currently have one. However you choose to
        describe your identity as well as whether or not you choose to label it
        is up to you and should make you comfortable, even if others don’t
        necessarily ‘get it’ initially.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">
      Is it okay to come out if I’m not sure about my identity yet?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Your decision to come out is completely up to you, thus you can come out
        whenever you want. There’s no one way to be “sure” about your identity,
        although some may choose to experiment with a label, name, or set of
        pronouns before sharing them with others. Some people may also choose to
        share these things with one or two people at first to see if it feels
        comfortable before telling others. Whatever the case, you should come
        out when it feels right to you.

      <p>
        Yes! Figuring out your identity can be a lifelong process and there’s no
        timeline any particular person must adhere to in order to figure out who
        they are. Sexuality and gender are fluid and your perception of yourself
        and others may change over time as well as the way you choose to
        identify yourself. Questioning, changing labels, and experimenting with
        your identity and presentation are normal and healthy experiences for
        queer and non-queer individuals alike.

      How do I let people know my pronouns?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Often the best way to tell others your pronouns is to simply tell them!
        If the person is a friend or family member, you might send a text, call
        them, or meet them in person to let them know you’d like them to begin
        using a different set of pronouns for you. If you have a less personal
        relationship with the person, such as with a teacher or coworker, you
        might send an email indicating your new pronouns instead. Other options
        for letting people know your pronouns are adding them to your email
        signature, changing your display name to include your pronouns, or
        introducing yourself by stating your pronouns after your name. There are
        lots of ways to let people know your pronouns, so do whatever feels
        right for you!
      </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">
      What do I do if the people who know my pronouns continually misgender me?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        It’s not uncommon for people who know a person’s pronouns to
        occasionally misgender them. If it’s a rare occurrence, it’s likely that
        the person is simply adjusting to using new pronouns for you. If this
        becomes a common occurrence, however, it can be disheartening. If the
        person is a friend or family member, giving a gentle verbal reminder or
        sending them a text as a reminder may be helpful. If the person is a
        coworker or teacher, you might send them an email to remind them of your
        pronouns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, if someone is intentionally misgendering you, there are
        steps you can take to avoid this in the future. If this person is a
        family member or friend, let them know that using your correct pronouns
        are not simply “preferred” but required for having a relationship with
        you. Though they may not fully understand or relate to your identity,
        you should let them know that you still deserve the respect of having
        your pronouns honored. Although it may be difficult, set a firm boundary
        and stick to it. If they continue to intentionally misgender you, you
        may want to reconsider your relationship with this person. Ultimately,
        regardless of whether others respect your pronouns, you and your
        identity are valid and deserve respect.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the person is a coworker, teacher, medical professional, or any other
        person in a professional setting, there are other options for handling
        being intentionally misgendered. First, ensure the person knows that
        using your correct pronouns is not optional and that if they refuse, you
        will take further action to ensure your identity is respected. If they
        continue to intentionally misgender you, file a complaint with the
        school, office, or establishment where the offense took place. While
        they may not be able to make the person use your proper pronouns, they
        may be able to enforce punitive action and/or limit your interactions
        with this person.

      How can I let people know my preferred honorifics or what compliments
      honor me?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Often the best way is to simply tell them. If you’d rather not directly
        tell the people in your life your preferred honorifics or what
        adjectives they should use when complimenting you, however, a good rule
        is to wait until it comes up in conversation. Often this feels more
        natural than directly telling people and you don’t have to do the
        legwork of bringing it up since someone already mentioned it for you.

      What do I do if someone reacts negatively to me coming out?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        While it’s best to first come out to people you believe will be
        supportive, there’s unfortunately a possibility that some people you
        come out to might react negatively. Sometimes the person may simply need
        time to adjust and come to accept your identity in the future. Others
        may have false beliefs about LGBTQ people that may require
        deconstructing. You might ask them why they feel upset about you sharing
        your identity with them. Whatever the reason, know your identity is
        valid and that you deserve acceptance. While it may be difficult for
        some people to accept, you should not have to compromise your identity
        for anyone.

        Sometimes the simplest explanation is the best explanation. If the
        person you’re coming out to has very little understanding of the LGBTQ+
        community, you may choose to state the way you feel in the simplest
        terms possible. This may include specifically what your gender or
        sexuality means to you as well as the actual definition of the label you
        use to describe it.

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        If you know another queer person who you feel comfortable speaking to,
        you might ask them about their own experiences with figuring out their
        identity. Not all queer people will feel comfortable speaking on their
        experiences, but many will be willing to share, especially if they know
        you’re questioning and are seeking guidance. Additionally, reading about
        or watching videos on other queer people’s experiences may help you with
        your own journey.

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        The best way to interact with the queer community anonymously is online.
        There are queer spaces on nearly every popular social media platform
        that will allow you to interact with other members of the community
        without outing yourself. There may also be LGBTQ+ events in your area
        that take specific precautions for individuals who may not be out yet.
        If you’re interested in going to an LGBTQ+ event but are concerned about
        being outed, contact the event organizer to ask how you can safely
        attend.

        The LGBTQ+ community is very broad and, thanks to the internet, finding
        other queer people has never been easier. One way to meet other queer
        people is through LGBTQ+ Centers or local LGBTQ+ organizations. There
        are also lots of LGBTQ+ communities online where you can connect to
        other queer people worldwide. If you want to meet other queer people in
